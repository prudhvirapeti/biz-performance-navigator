Project: Parts Pricing & Sales Dashboard – PBIX Build Kit

Goal
Create a Power BI report that analyzes B2B parts pricing trends, top-selling parts, revenue impact, and regional sales.

Included assets (already in this portfolio):
- CSV: /portfolio/parts_pricing/dataset/parts_pricing_sales.csv
- SQL transform: /portfolio/parts_pricing/sql/parts_pricing_transform.sql
- DAX measures: /portfolio/parts_pricing/dax/parts_pricing_dax.txt

Step-by-step (approx. 10–15 min):
1) Data load
   - Get Data > Text/CSV > parts_pricing_sales.csv
   - Use Power Query to set column types (Date, text, numeric). Rename to Parts.

2) Optional: Apply SQL logic in Power Query
   - In Power Query, replicate logic from parts_pricing_transform.sql using Group By and Index/Shift (or native SQL if sourcing from a DB).
   - Add PriceChangePct per the SQL example.

3) Model
   - Create a simple Date table (DAX) and mark as Date table.
   - Relate Date[Date] to Parts[Date].

4) Measures (DAX)
   - Add measures from parts_pricing_dax.txt: [Total Revenue], [Units Sold], [Average Price], [Price Change %], etc.

5) Visuals
   - KPI cards: Total Revenue, Units Sold, Average Price, Price Change %.
   - Line chart: Average price by month.
   - Bar chart: Top parts by revenue.
   - Bar chart: Revenue by region.

6) Formatting
   - Consistent currency/percent formats.
   - Corporate theme with subtle accents.

7) Publish
   - Save as PBIX and Publish to Power BI Service (Workspace > New App).
