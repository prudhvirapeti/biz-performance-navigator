Project: Customer Order Trends Dashboard – PBIX Build Kit

Goal
Segment customers, track repeat orders, and visualize sales trends with retention and cadence KPIs.

Included assets (already in this portfolio):
- CSV: /portfolio/order_trends/dataset/customer_orders.csv
- SQL transform: /portfolio/order_trends/sql/customer_orders_transform.sql
- DAX measures: /portfolio/order_trends/dax/order_trends_dax.txt

Step-by-step (approx. 10–15 min):
1) Data load
   - Get Data > Text/CSV > customer_orders.csv
   - Types: OrderDate (Date), Revenue (Decimal), others text. Rename to Orders.

2) Optional: SQL logic in Power Query
   - Based on customer_orders_transform.sql, compute monthly counts and IsRepeat.

3) Model
   - Create Date table and mark as Date table. Relate Date[Date] to Orders[OrderDate].

4) Measures (DAX)
   - Use order_trends_dax.txt: [Orders], [Customers], [Avg Orders per Customer], [Retained Customers %], [Monthly Revenue].

5) Visuals
   - KPI cards: Retention %, Avg Orders/Customer, Orders (Latest Month).
   - Line chart: Monthly orders.
   - Donut/Pie: Revenue by segment.
   - Table: Top customers (orders, revenue).

6) Formatting
   - Percentages to one decimal, currency formatting.

7) Publish
   - Save PBIX and publish to Service; enable dashboards and share with stakeholders.
